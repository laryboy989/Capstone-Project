        </h6> November 8th, 2013<br />
        Supporters of Big Brothers Big Sisters can say proudly that they tipped the scales for Ben Gordon. Ben, a former Little Brother in our program, received a Goldwater Scholarship last year. Intelligent and determined, Ben earned this award for being one of America’s most elite science students.

        Researchers found that after 18 months of spending time with their Bigs, the Little Brothers and Little Sisters, compared to those children not in our program, were:
        <br />
            <ul>
            <li>46% less likely to begin using illegal drugs</li>
            <li>27% less likely to begin using alcohol</li>
            <li>52% less likely to skip school</li>
            <li>37% less likely to skip a class</li>
            <li>33% less likely to hit someone</li>
        </ul>
         They also found that the Littles were more confident of their performance in schoolwork and getting along better with their families.<br />
